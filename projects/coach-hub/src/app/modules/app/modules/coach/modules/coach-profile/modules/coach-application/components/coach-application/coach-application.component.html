  <h3>Coach Application</h3>
  <p>
    This section will appear on your Coach Hub public profile.
    If approved, this will be how clients find and book your services.
    Please don't just submit a copy of your resume or a link to your personal webpage.
    Put your best foot forward â€” use professional language mixed with some charm for the
    below sections to help clients get to know you.
